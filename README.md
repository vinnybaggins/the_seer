Test the abilities of Malbeth, the Seer

1. Think of a number between 0 and 255.
2. Click on all the cards that contain it.
3. Click on GUESS.
4. BEHOLD THE MAGIC!

____________________________________


The magic is based on binary numeration system. Each cards corresponds to a specific digit of a binary number: the first card contains all the numbers, from 1 to 255, whose first digit is 1, the second contains all numbers whose second digit is 1, and so on.
____________________________________


All the cards are not hardcoded in a table. Instead, the numbers are generated dynamically, by means of nested for loops.
The maximum number can be defined through the variable "power". In this case, the maximum number will be the result of 2 to the power of "power" (the variable).
In the code I posted, "power" is equal to 6, thence the maximum number is 2^6 = 255.
